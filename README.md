## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Start development easily.

### Install dependencies

First, you need to collect and install all packages running `npm install`.

Make sure you're using NPM instead of yarn.

### Run development server

If you already collected packages, you can start the development server running `npm start`
and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
